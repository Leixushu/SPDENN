# A Dicussion on Solving Partial Differential Equations using Neural Networks
Can neural networks learn to solve partial differential equations (PDEs)?  We investigate this question for two (systems of) PDEs, namely, the Poisson equation and the steady Navierâ€“Stokes equations.

## Poisson problem
The Poisson problem under consideration is given as 
$$-\nabla^2 u (\bm{x}) &= f(\bm{x}) \quad \text{in } \Omega$$
